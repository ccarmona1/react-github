Always read the package.json to understand the libraries we are using and the commands that we can run.

Config files must be small and simple, with no unnecessary options.

For common dev:

- Use yarn
- Use jest
- Don't add comments

For Frontend:

- Use React with latest features and best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use tailwindcss for styling

For UnitTests:

- Don't mock console logs
- Don't spy console or console logs
- use jest.mock
- Always run the unit tests to verify they pass, if they don't, fix them
